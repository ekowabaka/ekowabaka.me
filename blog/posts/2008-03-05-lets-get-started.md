I have always wanted to write a blog but the problem I had was I really didn't
know what to write about. I felt writing a blog about your personal life was
sick and anything I thought of already seemed to be out there. I was however
struck by this idea a few minutes ago and I decided to try it out.

So what do I intend to write about in my blog? Well I have learned by practice
that the best way to use something is to understand some of the details about
its internal workings. So on this blog I am going to write about how things
work, and anything that I like to talk about. That is why it is my blog ... lol.
If you dont agree go and burn up the sea! (Only if you can).
