I have a friend who is stuck on to Microsoft Windows. He is always blowing the
windows horn and he would readily stand up to defend MS-windows in any
situation.This friend always tries to show off cool things that MS-Windows can
do that Linux can't. We always argue about the power of windows and linux. Just
last week I paid a visit to this friend and he was teaching his girlfriend how
to use the computer (he was actually teaching her how to use microsoft windows).
He was explaining the options in the pop-up menu that appears when you
right-click on the desktop. When he got to the refresh option he said:

>This option allows you to refresh the computers CPU and memory so
that when any program is frozen it can be refreshed.

<!--more-->I instantly burst out laughing and he wondered why. I must state here
that I personally don't have anything against MS-Windows but I just can stand it
when someone lies to defend it. I argued with him for a while about this issue
but he didn't agree. I even gave him vivid proof but he still didn't take it.

When I got home, I asked another friend of mine what he thought the refresh
button on the windows desktop did. This time I wasn't surprised when he said
that it refreshed the memory of the computer. Curious to find out the general
perception I asked so many people who were expected to be experts in the
computer field. Most of the people I asked said that it refreshed the CPU and
the memory. I now understood why some people minimized their running
applications and constantly refreshed the desktop when something was freezing or
not responding. They don't know that they are actually giving the CPU more work
to do!

From what I understand as far as computers are concerned, the refresh button on
the desktop is intended to refresh the state of the icons on the desktop. I
stand to be challenged by anyone who thinks otherwise. Personally I think
Microsoft should label the "Refresh" menu option as "Refresh Desktop Icons .."
that would help remove this misconception and false belief.
