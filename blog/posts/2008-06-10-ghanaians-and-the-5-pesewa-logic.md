Almost a year ago a new set of bank notes and coins were released by the
government to replace the old bulky and cumbersome notes. I mean who wanted to
carry a bank note worth 20,000 cedis which is equivalent to just 2 dollars. This
move was embraced by everybody and I think one year down the line we are all
still getting used to it. At least my parents cannot laugh at me that our
generation didn't spend pesewas. For me when these new notes and coins were
released I was happy because we were now going to be able to pay arbitrarily any
price for anything. It was the end of the era where everything was increased by
500 cedis when the prices of fuel shot up.

As part of the new coins and bank notes was the 1pessewa coin. This coin was to
be the smallest unit of payment making any arbitrary payment amount possible.
However a year down the line the 1 pessewa coins are almost non existent. I
surprised the other day when I took a tro-tro and saw one. The mate gave it as
change to one of the passengers and she refused to take it. Nobody took the
coins in the car so I took it. I was then asking myself why don't they want the
1 pessewa coin. And also come to think of it we still increase the prices of
things by 5 pessewas as soon as the prices of petrol shoots. So what I am really
worried about is where are we going with all this? If we don't accept these
coins then I think we are just going back to the era where everything increased
by 5. This 5 pessewa logic would kill us.
