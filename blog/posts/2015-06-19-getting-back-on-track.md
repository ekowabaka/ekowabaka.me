I've always wanted to restart this blog but I also always wanted to do it in 
style. In that light it is with great joy that I wish to announce that I have 
sucessfully migrated the blog over from wordpress.com.
This blog is currently being hosted on GitHub (because that is what the cool kids
are doing now).

For the curious souls out there, the content of the blog can be found
[here](https://github.com/ekowabaka/ekowabaka.me) and the generated site
(which is most likely what you're reading) can also be found [here](https://github.com/ekowabaka/ekowabaka.github.io).
I promise to make a post soon (yeah veeeery soon) on how I performed this whole
migration.
